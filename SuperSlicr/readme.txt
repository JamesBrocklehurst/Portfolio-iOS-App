** Installation **

Choose 'Load Actions' from the Actions Palette Contextual Menu.

** Usage **

1) Select which export setting you would like from the Actions Palette, either JPEG (High), PNG-24 Standard, or PNG-24 iOS Scaling.

2) Select any combination of Layers that you wish to merge into a single 'slice'

3) 'Play' the Action or use the Keyboard Shortcut

** Results **

All export setting will create a new document of your selected layers, cropped to the combined pixel bounds, and then bring up the appropriate settings in the 'Save for Web' dialogue.

- 'JPEG (High)' will flatten the selected layers against your current background colour.
- 'PNG-24 Standard' will merge your selected layers and place them against a transparent background.
- 'PNG-24 iOS Scaling' will do the same as 'Standard' except it will generate both a Standard Display and Retina Display version. It is important to note that the action assumes that the original file has been created to Retina Display dimensions, as it performs a scale-down rather than scale-up.

** ChangeLog **
